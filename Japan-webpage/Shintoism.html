                <p>Shintō (or Shintoism), indigenous religious beliefs and practices of Japan. The word Shintō, which literally means “the way of kami” (generally sacred or divine power, specifically the various gods or deities), came into use in order to distinguish indigenous Japanese beliefs from Buddhism, which had been introduced into Japan in the 6th century CE. 
                    Shintō has no founder, no official sacred scriptures in the strict sense, and no fixed dogmas, but it has preserved its guiding beliefs throughout the ages.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Shintō consists of the traditional Japanese religious practices as well as the beliefs and life attitudes that are in accord with these practices. 
                    Shintō is more readily observed in the social life of the Japanese people and in their personal motivations than in a pattern of formal belief or philosophy.
                     It remains closely connected with the Japanese value system and the Japanese people’s ways of thinking and acting.
                    Shintō can be roughly classified into the following three major types: Shrine Shintō, Sect Shintō, and Folk Shintō. 
                    Shrine Shintō (Jinja Shintō), which has been in existence from the beginning of Japanese history to the present day, constitutes a main current of Shintō tradition. Shrine Shintō includes within its structure the now defunct State Shintō (Kokka Shintō)—based on the total identity of religion and state—and has close relations with the Japanese Imperial family. 
                    Sect Shintō (Kyōha Shintō) is a relatively new movement consisting of 13 major sects that originated in Japan around the 19th century and of several others that emerged after World War II. Each sect was organized into a religious body by either a founder or a systematizer. 
                    Folk Shintō (Minzoku Shintō) is an aspect of Japanese folk belief that is closely connected with the other types of Shintō. 
                    It has no formal organizational structure nor doctrinal formulation but is centred in the veneration of small roadside images and in the agricultural rites of rural families. 
                    These three types of Shintō are interrelated: Folk Shintō exists as the substructure of Shintō faith, and a Sect Shintō follower is usually also a parishioner (ujiko) of a particular Shintō shrine.

                    It is in the city of Hatsukaichi in Hiroshima Prefecture in Japan. 
                    The shrine complex is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Japanese government has designated several buildings and possessions as National Treasures.

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <h3>History To 1900</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        Much remains unknown about religion in Japan during the Paleolithic and Neolithic ages. 
                        It is unlikely, however, that the religion of these ages has any direct connection with Shintō. 
                        Yayoi culture, which originated in the northern area of the island of Kyushu in about the 3rd or 2nd century BCE, 
                        is directly related to later Japanese culture and hence to Shintō. 
                        Among the primary Yayoi religious phenomena were agricultural rites and shamanism.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Early clan religion and ceremonies</h3>
                    <p>
                        In ancient times small states were gradually formed at various places. By the middle of the 4th century CE, a nation with an ancestor of the present Imperial Household as its head had probably been established. 
                        The constituent unit of society at that time was the uji (clan or family), and the head of each uji was in charge of worshiping the clan’s ujigami—its particular tutelary or guardian deity. The prayer for good harvest in spring and the harvest ceremony in autumn were two major festivals honouring the ujigami. Divination, water purification, 
                        and lustration (ceremonial purification), which are all mentioned in the Japanese classics, became popular, and people started to build shrines for their kami.
                        Ancient Shintō was polytheistic. People found kami in nature, which ruled seas or mountains, as well as in outstanding men. They also believed in kami of ideas such as growth, creation, and judgment. 
                        Though each clan made the tutelary kami the core of its unity, such kami were not necessarily the ancestral deities of the clan. 
                        Sometimes kami of nature and kami of ideas were regarded as their tutelary kami.
                        Two different views of the world were present in ancient Shintō. One was the three-dimensional view in which the Plain of High Heaven (Takama no Hara, the kami’s world), Middle Land (Nakatsukuni, the present world), and the Hades (Yomi no Kuni, the world after death) were arranged in vertical order. 
                        The other view was a two-dimensional one in which this world and the Perpetual Country (Tokoyo, a utopian place far beyond the sea) existed in horizontal order. 
                        Though the three-dimensional view of the world (which is also characteristic of North Siberian and Mongolian shamanistic culture) became the representative view observed in Japanese myths, the two-dimensional view of the world (which is also present in Southeast Asian culture) was dominant among the populace.

                    <h3>The encounter with Buddhism</h3>

                    <p>
                        Buddhism was officially introduced into Japan in 552 CE and developed gradually. 
                        In the 8th century there emerged tendencies to interpret Shintō from a Buddhist viewpoint. 
                        Shintō kami were viewed as protectors of Buddhism; hence, shrines for tutelary kami were built within the precincts of Buddhist temples. Kami were made equivalent to deva, or “gods.” 
                        According to Buddhist teachings, the deva are said to be undergoing the same suffering (dukkha) within the endless cycle of death and rebirth (samsara) that all creatures experience. 
                        Help was therefore offered to kami in the form of Buddhist discipline. Buddhist temples were even built within Shintō shrine precincts, and Buddhist sutras (scriptures) were read in front of kami. By the late 8th century, kami were thought to be avatars (incarnations) of buddhas 
                        (enlightened individuals who had attained liberation [moksha] from samsara) and bodhisattvas (buddhas-to-be). Bodhisattva names were given to kami, and Buddhist statues were placed even in the inner sanctuaries of Shintō shrines. 
                        In some cases, Buddhist priests were in charge of the management of Shintō shrines.
                    </p>
                   <p>
                    From the beginning of the Kamakura period (1192–1333), theories of Shintō-Buddhist amalgamation were formulated. The most important of the syncretic schools to emerge were Ryōbu (Dual Aspect) 
                    Shintō and Sannō (“King of the Mountain,” a common name of the guardian deity of Tendai Buddhism) Shintō. 
                    According to Ryōbu Shintō—also called Shingon Shintō—the two realms of the universe in Shingon Buddhist teachings corresponded to the kami Amaterasu Ōmikami and Toyuke (Toyouke) Ōkami enshrined at the Ise-daijingū 
                    (Grand Shrine of Ise, commonly called Ise-jingū, or Ise Shrine) in Mie prefecture. The theorists of Sannō Shintō—also called Tendai Shintō—interpreted the Tendai belief in the central, or absolute, truth of the universe 
                    (i.e., the fundamental buddha nature) as being equivalent to the Shintō concept that the sun goddess Amaterasu was the source of the universe. 
                    These two sects brought certain esoteric Buddhist rituals into Shintō. 
                    Buddhistic Shintō was popular for several centuries and was influential until its extinction at the Meiji Restoration.

                   <h3>Shintō reaction against Buddhism</h3>
                   <p>
                    Ise, or Watarai, Shintō was the first theoretical school of anti-Buddhistic Shintō in that it attempted to exclude Buddhist accretions and also tried to formulate a pure Japanese version. Watarai Shintō appeared in Ise during the 13th century as a reaction against the Shintō-Buddhist amalgamation. Konton (chaos), or Kizen (non-being), was the basic kami of the universe for Watarai Shintō and was regarded as the basis of all beings, including the buddhas and bodhisattvas. Purification, which had been practiced since the time of ancient Shintō, was given much deeper spiritual meanings. Shōjiki (defined as uprightness or righteousness) and prayers were emphasized as the means by which to be united with kami.
                    Yoshida Shintō, a school in Kyōto that emerged during the 15th century, inherited various aspects handed down from Watarai Shintō and also showed some Daoist influence. The school’s doctrines were largely the work of Yoshida Kanetomo (1435–1511). Its fundamental kami (the source of all things and beings in the universe) was Taigen Sonjin (the Great Exalted One). According to its teaching, if one is truly purified, his heart can be the kami’s abode. The ideal of inner purification was a mysterious state of mind in which one worshiped the kami that lived in one’s own heart. Although the Watarai and Yoshida schools were thus free of Buddhistic theories, the influence of Chinese thought was still present.

                   <h3>Neo-Confucian Shintō</h3>
                   <p>
                    In 1603 the Tokugawa shogunate was founded in Edo (Tokyo), and contact between Shintō and Confucianism was resumed. Scholars tried to interpret Shintō from the standpoint of neo-Confucianism (a philosophical and ethical movement that emerged in China in the Song dynasty), emphasizing the unity of Shintō and Confucian teachings. Schools emerged based on the teachings of the Chinese philosophers Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming, and neo-Confucianism became an official subject of study for warriors. Yoshikawa Koretaru (1616–94) and Yamazaki Ansai (1619–82) were two representative scholars of Confucian Shintō. They added neo-Confucian interpretations to the traditional theories handed down from Watarai Shintō, and each established a new school. The taiji (Supreme Ultimate) concept of neo-Confucianism was regarded as identical with the first kami of the Nihon shoki, or Nihon-gi (“Chronicles of Japan”). One of the characteristics of Yoshikawa’s theories was his emphasis on political philosophy. Imperial virtues (wisdom, benevolence, and courage), symbolized by the Sanshu no Shinki (Three Sacred Treasures), and national ethics, such as loyalty and filial piety, constituted the way to rule the state. Yamazaki Ansai further developed this tendency and advocated both mystical pietism and ardent emperor worship.

                   <h3>Fukko Shintō</h3>
                   <p>
                    Fukko (Restoration, or Revival) Shintō is one of the Kokugaku (National Learning) movements that started toward the end of the 17th century. Advocates of this school maintained that the norms of Shintō should not be sought in Buddhist or Confucian interpretations but in the beliefs and life-attitudes of their ancestors as clarified by philological study of the Japanese classics. Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801) represented this school. His emphasis was on the belief in musubi (the mystical power of becoming or of creation), which had been popular in ancient Shintō, and on a this-worldly view of life, which anticipated the eternal progress of the world in ever-changing mutations. These beliefs, together with the inculcation of respect for the Imperial line and the teaching of absolute faith—according to which all problems beyond human capability were turned over to kami—exercised great influence on modern Shintō doctrines.
                    The most important successor of Motoori in the field of Shintō was Hirata Atsutane (1776–1843), who showed the influence of Roman Catholic teachings in some respects—derived from the writings of Jesuits in China—by advancing the idea of a creator god and retribution for ethical and religious failings in another world. These doctrines, however, were not accepted into the main current of Shintō. Hirata developed the philological studies started by Motoori and trained many capable disciples. He also wrote prayers, worked out formulas for family cults of tutelary kami and ancestors, and promoted Shintō practices. His spirituality, reverence for the emperor, and desire to restore the spirit of ancient Shintō enlisted many supporters and served as one of the factors in bringing about the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

                   <h3>Formation of Sect Shintō</h3>
                   <p>
                    During the latter part of the 19th century, new religious movements emerged out of the social confusion and unrest of the people. What these new movements taught differed widely: some were based on mountain-worship groups, which were half-Buddhist and half-Shintō; some placed emphasis on purification and ascetic practices; and some combined Confucian and Shintō teachings. New religious movements—such as Kurozumi-kyō, founded by Kurozumi Munetada (1780–1850); Konkō-kyō (Konkō is the religious name of the founder of this group and means, literally, “golden light”) by Kawate Bunjirō (1814–83); and Tenri-kyō (tenri means “divine reason or wisdom”) by Nakayama Miki (1798–1887)—were based mostly on individual religious experiences and aimed at healing diseases or spiritual salvation. These sectarian Shintō groups, numbering 13 during the Meiji period (1868–1912), were stimulated and influenced by Restoration Shintō.

                    <h2>Shintō Literature And Mythology</h2>
                    <p>
                        Broadly speaking, Shintō has no founder. When the Japanese people and Japanese culture became aware of themselves, Shintō was already there. Nor has it any official scripture that can be compared to the Bible in Judaism and Christianity or to the Qurʾān in Islam. The Kojiki (“Records of Ancient Matters”) and the Nihon shoki (“Chronicles of Japan”) are regarded in a sense as sacred books of Shintō. They were written in 712 and 720 CE, respectively, and are compilations of the oral traditions of ancient Shintō. But they are also books about the history, topography, and literature of ancient Japan. It is possible to construct Shintō doctrines from them by interpreting the myths and religious practices they describe.
                        Stories partially similar to those found in Japanese mythology can be found in the myths of Southeast Asia, and in the style of description in Japanese myths some Chinese influence is detectable. The core of the mythology, however, consists of tales about the sun goddess Amaterasu Ōmikami, the ancestress of the Imperial Household, and tales of how her direct descendants unified the Japanese people under their authority. In the beginning, according to Japanese mythology, a certain number of kami simply emerged, and a pair of kami, Izanagi and Izanami, gave birth to the Japanese islands, as well as to the kami who became ancestors of the various clans. Amaterasu, the ruler of Takama no Hara; the moon god Tsukiyomi no Mikoto; and Susanoo (Susanowo) no Mikoto, the ruler of the nether regions, were the most important among them. A descendant of Amaterasu, Jimmu, is said to have become the first emperor of Japan. Japanese mythology says that the Three Sacred Treasures (the mirror, the sword, and the jewels), which are still the most revered symbols of the Imperial Household, were first given by Amaterasu to her grandson. The Inner Shrine (Naikū) of the Ise-jingū is dedicated to this ancestral goddess and is the most venerated shrine in Shintō.
                        The Japanese classics also contain myths and legends concerning the so-called 800 myriads of kami (yao-yorozu no kami). Some of them are the tutelary deities of clans and later became the tutelary kami of their respective local communities. Many others, however, are not enshrined in sanctuaries and have no direct connections with the actual Shintō faith.

                        <br>
                        <h5>Gate (torii)</h5>
                        The torii is a gate which marks the entrance to a sacred area, usually but not necessarily a shrine. A shrine may have any number of torii (Fushimi Inari Taisha has thousands) made of wood, stone, metal, concrete or any other material. They can be found in different places within a shrine's precincts to signify an increased level of holiness.

                        Torii can often be found also at Buddhist temples, however they are an accepted symbol of Shinto, and as such are used to mark shrines on maps.

                        The origin of the torii is unclear, and no existing theory has been accepted as valid. They may for example have originated in India as a derivative of the torana gates in the monastery of Sanchi, which is located in central India.

                        <h5>Pathway (sandō)</h5>
                        The sandō is the road approaching either a Shinto shrine or a Buddhist temple. Its point of origin is usually straddled in the first case by a Shinto torii, in the second by a Buddhist sanmon, gates which mark the beginning of the shrine's or temple territory. There can also be stone lanterns and other decorations at any point along its course. There can be more than one sandō, in which case the main one is called omote-sandō, or front sandō, ura-sandō, or rear sandō, etc.

                        <h5>Fountain (chōzuya)</h5>
                        Before entering the shrine, visitors are supposed to wash their hands and mouths at a fountain built to the purpose called chōzuya or temizuya.

                        <h5>Guardian lion-dogs (komainu)</h5>
                        The two "lions" in front of a shrine are in effect warden dogs called komainu (狛犬). They were so called because they were thought to have been brought to Japan from China via Korea, and their name derives from "Koma" (高麗), the Japanese term for the Korean kingdom of Koguryo. They are almost identical, but one has the mouth open, the other closed. This is a very common pattern in statue pairs at both temples and shrines, and has an important symbolic meaning. The open mouth is pronouncing the first letter of the sanskrit alphabet ("a"), the closed one the last ("um"), representing the beginning and the end of all things. The one with the open mouth is called shishi (獅子), the other komainu, a name that in time came to be used for both animals.

                        <h5>Worship hall</h5>
                        The haiden is the hall of worship or oratory of the shrine. It is generally placed in front of the shrine's main sanctuary (honden) and often built on a larger scale than the latter. The haiden is often connected to the honden by a heiden, or hall of offerings. While the honden is the place for the enshrined kami and off-limits to the general public, the haiden provides a space for ceremonies and for worshiping the kami.

                        <h5>Offertory hall</h5>
                        The heiden is the part of a shrine used to house offerings, and normally consists of a section linking the honden and the haiden . It can also be called chūden (中殿) or in other ways, and its position can sometimes vary. In spite of its name, nowadays it is used mostly for rituals.

                        <h5>Sanctuary (honden)</h5>
                        The honden, also called shinden (神殿) is the most sacred building of shrine, intended purely for the use of the enshrined kami. The kami, in itself incorporeal, is usually represented physically by a mirror or sometimes by a statue. The building is normally in the rear of the shrine and closed to the general public. The sections Most common shrine styles and Other styles below are dedicates specifically to honden and their characteristics.

                        Hokora<br>
                        A hokora or hokura is a very small Shinto shrine either found on the precincts of a larger shrine and dedicated to folk kami, or on a street side, enshrining kami not under the jurisdiction of any large shrine. Dōsojin, minor kami protecting travelers from evil spirits, may for example be enshrined in a hokora.

                        Sessha, massha<br>
                        Sessha (摂社, auxiliary shrine) and massha (末社, branch shrine), also called eda-miya (枝宮, branch shrines) are small or miniature shrines having a deep historical relationship with a more important shrine or with the kami it enshrines, and fall under that shrine's jurisdiction. The two terms used to have different meanings, but must be today considered synonyms. For this reason, this kind of shrine is now sometimes called setsumatsusha (摂末社).
